      How To Be A Good Suspect

      If you've never been suspected of murder before, you might
      appreciate some of these tips:

      Don't give away too much information about yourself. Make people
      work to get at your secrets.

      Take notes. Pay attention. Listen for clues.

      Don't let people off the hook too easily. Be persistent. Remember: a
      murder has been committed and you need to get to the bottom of it.

      Stay in character. If you don't know the answer to someone's
      questions, bluff. Say something your character might say, but don't
      lie just to confuse people.

      Be evasive, put some spin on the truth, but try to stay within the
      bounds of "reality."

      If you like, carefully detach the chart on the last page of this
      clue booklet, and use it to keep track of everyone's movements.

      Above all, relax and have fun. You're only facing possible life in
      prison without parole.






































      * ROUND 1 : Buffy

      Reveal this information only if it's unavoidable:

      1 )  You arrived in the theater at around 7:35.  You brought that
      damned love potion with you, and spent most of the first and second
      acts trying to figure out how to see Jeremy.  You wore a blue velvet
      dress and white evening gloves.

      2 )  You left your seat at nine o'clock, went downstairs to the
      lounge and had a glass of red wine.  By 9:25, you'd discovered the
      unlocked doorway leading to the service corridor, and had found your
      way into Jeremy's dressing room.  You sat in a dark corner of the
      room, waiting nervously for Jeremy, the love of your life. 

      3 )  Jeremy showed up at 9:35, according to the dressing room clock.

       You offered him your love potion.  He took the bottle, and laughing
      at you, threw it on the floor.  It was unbelievable, his scorn, the
      rejection!  He strutted out of the room, leaving you sitting there
      like a fool. 

      You must reveal this information during this round:

      1 )  You saw your husband Watson take a seat in the audience fifteen
      to twenty minutes before the show started.  You hid your face -- you
      didn't want him to know you were there.  If he gets upset now, you
      might ask him what the hell he was doing there. 

      2 )  Jeremy once said that SpongeBob would probably be reincarnated
      as a sponge.  Why would he say a thing like that?




































      * ROUND 2 : Buffy

      You must reveal this information during this round:

      1 )  When the curtain dropped on Act I (8:30), you saw Edith heading
      up the aisle and out into the lobby. 

      2 )  The night after Jeremy brought Lisa home for dinner, Jeremy
      told you that felt he should do something real to help in the
      struggle against oppression.  You asked him if that meant taking up
      arms and bombing buildings, and he said "Maybe." 

      3 )  During intermission between the first and second acts, you saw
      Scully standing at the foot of the aisle, with her back to the
      stage.  She appeared to be studying the crowd, looking for someone. 

      A few moments later, at perhaps 8:40, Scully walked around the to
      the right of the stage and disappeared.  (You nervously pulled your
      bottle of magic herbs from your evening bag, and stared into it. 
      Scully , that cheap floozy.) 















































      * ROUND 3 : Buffy

      You must reveal this information during this round:

      1 )  Just before the curtain went up on Act II (around 8:45), you
      saw someone a few rows down from you toss something at the stage. 
      It might have been a small bouquet.  It landed in the audience. 

      2 )  You saw Watson come out of the door to the right of the stage
      as the curtain went up on the second act (8:45).  In the harsh,
      reflected glare of the red-hot footlights, his face was a mask of
      despair. 

      3 )  Once, Watson asked you if you ever planned to get a job.  You
      mentioned that you knew a woman named Edith who was really sharp
      when it came to business, but who was probably a big flop at
      romance. Watson replied: "Yeah, but she takes direction well.  And
      she's quick to learn her lines. . ."  You asked him if he knew her,
      but he changed the subject.  Why not ask him about it, now that all
      three of you are in the room together? 

      4 )  As the curtain went up on the second act, someone came rushing
      up the aisle, clutching a twig or a flower or something, a look of
      terror on his face. It was SpongeBob.










































      * ROUND 4 : Buffy

      You must reveal this information during this round:

      1 )  At 9:30 you were standing in Jeremy's dressing room, just
      inside the doorway.  You overheard Edith and Summers arguing.  Edith
      was almost in tears, as Summers ranted: "I'm sick and tired of all
      this pretending, all these lies!  I want you to star in another
      movie, but this time, without that stupid white mask." Edith sobbed,

      "Maybe you're right, Jeremy."

      2 )  A minute later, you were sitting in a dark corner of the
      dressing room, waiting for Jeremy.  Scully walked in, but she didn't
      see you. She dropped a folded-up piece of paper on Jeremy's makeup
      table, then ran out.  You didn't think much of it at the time. 

      3 )  When you talked to Jeremy in his dressing room, he complained
      that all his old friends were going crazy.  "Even SpongeBob" he
      said.  "I grew up with this guy, and now he's hounding me with
      "anonymous" letters.  And he denies it!"  Summers didn't go into any
      detail.

      Explain:



      You may want to cast one of these optional votes. (This is a good
      opportunity to make up for some of the awful things you may have

      Most Likely To Commit Murder


      Thanks for your time! Carefully detach this sheet from your clue
      booklet and present it to your host. Then, on to the thrilling
      conclusion...

























      Read these in order! You're number 1 

      It's true that I've been nuts about Jeremy ever since our secret
      affair in Berkeley.  Really nuts; on the night of the murder, I even
      tried to get him to drink a love potion I cooked up.  He laughed at
      me, threw the potion on the floor, and strutted out, leaving me
      there looking like a fool.  I could have killed him, but I didn't.

      They found fragments of a wine-stained napkin on the murder weapon,
      and  some smudged fingerprints.  Those fingerprints weren't mine: I
      wore white evening gloves the whole night.  I could have taken my
      gloves off and then shot Jeremy, but why would I do that? No, I left
      the theater before he was killed, went back to my hotel and cried
      myself to sleep.  I'm giving up witchcraft. I want to learn
      something useful...like computer programming.
