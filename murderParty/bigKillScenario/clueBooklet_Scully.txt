      How To Be A Good Suspect

      If you've never been suspected of murder before, you might
      appreciate some of these tips:

      Don't give away too much information about yourself. Make people
      work to get at your secrets.

      Take notes. Pay attention. Listen for clues.

      Don't let people off the hook too easily. Be persistent. Remember: a
      murder has been committed and you need to get to the bottom of it.

      Stay in character. If you don't know the answer to someone's
      questions, bluff. Say something your character might say, but don't
      lie just to confuse people.

      Be evasive, put some spin on the truth, but try to stay within the
      bounds of "reality."

      If you like, carefully detach the chart on the last page of this
      clue booklet, and use it to keep track of everyone's movements.

      Above all, relax and have fun. You're only facing possible life in
      prison without parole.






































      * ROUND 1 : Scully

      Reveal this information only if it's unavoidable:

      1 )  For the past six weeks, you've been sending notes to Summers,
      supposedly written by his accomplice in the murder of your fiancee,
      Gunter Emmerich.  You hoped to force Jeremy into contacting his
      partner in crime, so you could learn his or her identity.

      2 )  You were with Jeremy in his dressing room before the show,
      until about 7:40.

      You must reveal this information during this round:

      1 )  You walked into the dressing room before the show (at about
      7:10), interrupting an argument between Lisa Simpson and Summers. 
      Elegantly dressed in a cashmere coat, Lisa demanded money.  Jeremy
      laughed, and said: "If blackmail leads to more blackmail, that's
      fine with me.  Now get out of here before I strangle you."  Lisa
      stormed out.  You stayed behind, and helped Jeremy into his costume.


      2 )  About a half-hour later, Jeremy said:  "I need a few minutes
      alone."  As you stepped into the corridor, you heard a mettalic
      clatter.  You saw Lisa, hunched over in the doorway near the spiral
      staircase, apparently picking up whatever had fallen.  This metallic
      object disappeared inside that cashmere coat.  You turned and went
      out to the lounge for a drink of red wine.

      3 )  If anyone asks you about that report of a "tragic ending to
      your first affair," which appeared in "Playbill" magazine, lie,
      change the subject, make something up.  Gunter's murderer could be
      in this room. That murderer mustn't find out who you are.


































      * ROUND 2 : Scully

      Reveal this information only if it's unavoidable:

      1 )  You had a couple of glasses of red wine in the lounge, then
      went upstairs.  You sat down in the audience at eight o'clock.

      2 )  After the first act, you went down to the stage and  surveyed
      the audience.  You didn't find anything interesting, so you went
      around to the right of the stage and went through the door there.

      You must reveal this information during this round:

      1 )  You just remembered something: after Jeremy ordered Lisa out of
      his dressing room (before the show), he muttered something like:
      "It'll serve 'em both right...shake down one phoney to pay off
      another..."

















































      * ROUND 3 : Scully

      Reveal this information only if it's unavoidable:

      1 )  Backstage, you felt yourself drawn to the densely wooded set
      used in Act I.  You wandered through the underbrush, and remained
      hidden there throughout the second act.

      You must reveal this information during this round:

      1 )  You happened to be on stage in the wooded set used in the first
      act of The Big Kill. (If anyone asks you what you were doing there,
      tell them you wanted to be close to Jeremy.) Just before the curtain
      rose on Act II, you saw John Watson and Summers come through the
      stairway door and up onto the stage.  Watson was pleading with
      Summers: "You can't tell my wife she's living with an impostor!
      She's not strong enough, you know that!"  Summers replied: "Then
      you'll do as I say.  And remember, I want small bills, cash in a
      bag.  Now get off this stage!"

      2 )  You're certain that one of the people here tonight was with
      Summers when he killed Gunter.  You'll never have as good an
      opportunity as this to flush out Jeremy's accomplice, in front of
      witnesses.  Plant Gunter's identification papers someplace where you
      know they'll be found -- like in the bathroom, or the refrigerator. 

      DON'T LET ANYONE SEE YOU DOING IT, AND PRETEND YOU'VE NEVER SEEN IT
      BEFORE! 







































      * ROUND 4 : Scully

      Reveal this information only if it's unavoidable:

      1 )  At 9:25 you entered Jeremy's dressing room and dropped another
      note on his makeup table. 

      You must reveal this information during this round:

      1 )  You happened to be looking through Jeremy's desk one day, when
      you found a stack of desperate, pitiful love letters all signed with
      the initial "B". They'd been mailed to him over the span of many
      years.  One of the earliest letters contained a tiny dried-up frog's
      eye, some moldy mushrooms, and a lock of  hair.  The letters
      themselves were frequently incoherent.

      2 )  Jeremy was always sending envelopes full of money to different
      post office boxes around the country.  And some militant radical
      action -- like a bombing or an armored car robbery -- would always
      happen soon after in the area where Jeremy  had sent the money.

      3 )  In the lounge, at about 9:25,  you saw an usher going into the
      men's room to help a man complaining about a "naked fellow in one of
      the bathroom stalls.  He won't come out -- he sounds quite mad!"

      Thanks for your time! Carefully detach this sheet from your clue
      booklet and present it to your host. Then, on to the thrilling
      conclusion...

























      Read these in order! You're number 5 

      I loved Gunter Emmerich.  He was my fiancee, and I've wanted to
      avenge his murder ever since that moonlit night so long ago.  Gunter
      hiked into the woods with his walking stick to scout out a place for
      us to camp.  He must have stumbled over Jeremy.  When Gunter didn't
      return, I went in looking for him.  I got to Jeremy's camp just in
      time to see them dragging his body away.  I only saw Jeremy's face,
      but I knew there were two of them.  I went for help, but when I got
      back, the only thing left of Gunter was his crumpled student ID.

      I only recently discovered who Jeremy Summers was, when I recognized
      his face on the tv screen.  He was easy to meet, and attract.  The
      fool fell in love with me, but I hated him.  I thought that if I
      hounded him with notes, hounded him about the killing, he would lead
      me to his real partner in crime.  Well, now I know who that is.

      But I didn't kill Hb Imy. Why should I have?  When he died, I still
      had no idea who his accomplice was.  My dropping off that note in
      his dressing room proves that.  No, I returned to my seat after I
      dropped off the note. And when the curtain rose, I was saddened to
      see Jeremy dead.  Saddened, because I thought then that Gunter's
      murderers would both escape justice forever.
