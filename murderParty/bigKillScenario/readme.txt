As part of my "Make Your Own Murder Party, Explained in 64 Seconds" video (https://youtu.be/BM53VBa2vWk ), I generated a 6-player game using The Big Kill scenario.

I picked various fictional characters to invite.  Unfortunately, when I selected Buffy (the vampire slayer) Summers as a participant and game host, I didn't notice that the murder victim's name is Jeremy Summers, so there may be a little confusion on the last names (D'oh!).

SpongeBob was randomly selected by the program as the murderer.  Skully's and SpongBob's invitations contain game props, as does the host materials printout.

These files were created via Commodore 64 virtual printing:
