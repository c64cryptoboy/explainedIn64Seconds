      How To Be A Good Suspect

      If you've never been suspected of murder before, you might
      appreciate some of these tips:

      Don't give away too much information about yourself. Make people
      work to get at your secrets.

      Take notes. Pay attention. Listen for clues.

      Don't let people off the hook too easily. Be persistent. Remember: a
      murder has been committed and you need to get to the bottom of it.

      Stay in character. If you don't know the answer to someone's
      questions, bluff. Say something your character might say, but don't
      lie just to confuse people.

      Be evasive, put some spin on the truth, but try to stay within the
      bounds of "reality."

      If you like, carefully detach the chart on the last page of this
      clue booklet, and use it to keep track of everyone's movements.

      Above all, relax and have fun. You're only facing possible life in
      prison without parole.






































      * ROUND 1 : Edith

      Reveal this information only if it's unavoidable:

      1 )  You went to the opening night performance of "The Big Kill" 
      intending to change Summers' mind about revealing your past to the
      world. You still had no idea why he would put you through such an
      ordeal.

      You must reveal this information during this round:

      1 )  You got into the theater lobby at about 7:30.  You noticed Lisa
      heading downstairs toward the lounge.

      2 )  When you found your seat in the audience, about 7:35, you
      noticed SpongeBob sitting several rows down from you, closer to the
      stage.

      3 )   You recall you found a copy of "Playbill," the Broadway show
      guide.  There was an article about "The Big Kill"  in it, and a puff
      piece on Summers and his girlfriend Scully. It said that years ago
      Scully was engaged to some guy, but the "affair ended tragically." 
      Maybe she wants to talk about it.











































      * ROUND 2 : Edith

      Reveal this information only if it's unavoidable:

      1 )  After the first act (which you found boring and
      self-indulgent), you left your seat and went downstairs to the
      lounge for a drink. You ended up having four glasses of red wine.

      2 )  You were pretty well soused when you decided to do something
      about Jeremy's plan to reveal your past.  You called your business
      manager in Berkeley and told him to cancel the initial public
      offering of "Cutting Edge" stock.  He argued with you -- he couldn't
      understand why you'd do such a thing.  But you held your ground. 
      Then you had another glass of wine.

      You must reveal this information during this round:

      1 )  You recall the first night you spent with Jeremy in the
      Berkeley house.  He was down the hall in the bathroom, and you lay
      half asleep in his bed. Suddenly, a barely-dressed woman tiptoed
      into the dark room. "Jeremy, we're going into our third month," she
      giggled.  "When are you going to tell the world how much you love
      me?" Confused, you asked her what she was talking about. She gasped
      and fled the room, but you glimpsed her face: it was Buffy!










































      * ROUND 3 : Edith

      You must reveal this information during this round:

      1 )  At about five to nine, you saw SpongeBob stumble into the
      lounge, a wild, hunted look in his eye.  He threw something in a
      trashcan.  On a whim, you took it, and followed him as he headed for
      the doorway leading to the dressing rooms.  Show everyone the twig
      you found in the garbage.

      2 )  Five minutes later, you watched as SpongeBob entered Jeremy's
      dressing room.  He apparently didn't see you, at least, that's what
      you thought at the time.  You went into an unused dressing room,
      further down the hallway, out of idle curiousity. 




















































      * ROUND 4 : Edith

      You must reveal this information during this round:

      1 )  At 9:25, you heard Summers and SpongeBob outside the door of
      the unused dressing room.  SpongeBob was babbling about a "red net"
      or a "rent check" or something like that.  Then he swore
      hysterically that he wasn't "sending any notes."  At this point, you
      heard a slap, then Summers telling SpongeBob to "get up, and get
      yourself together.  I'll deal with you later."  A moment later, you
      heard a muffled curse, peeked out, and saw only Summers leaning
      against the wall.

      Reveal this information only if it's unavoidable:

      1 )  A couple of minutes later, you stepped out of the unused
      dressing room and confronted Summers.  Drunk and confused, you
      demanded to know why he insisted on revealing your role in the Mask 
      films.  He told you he was "tired of all this pretending, all these
      lies!"  He said he wanted you to star in another "Mask" film, but
      this time "without that stupid white mask..."  The intensity of
      Jeremy's attack of artistic integrity left you frustrated and
      bewildered. He seemed intent on this awful invasion of your privacy.


      The situation could not be resolved in a five minute conversation.
      So, in order to buy time, you hit him with your best weeping act
      (you are a great actress, after all) and told him you thought he
      might be right, and that you wanted to talk to him about it at
      length. He grinned strangely and went into his dressing room.

      As far as you were concerned, the issue was far from settled.  You
      got a grip on yourself, and made plans to finish your conversation
      with Jeremy.  Then you noticed the spiral staircase leading up to
      the stage.

      Most Likely To Commit Murder


      Thanks for your time! Carefully detach this sheet from your clue
      booklet and present it to your host. Then, on to the thrilling
      conclusion...

























      Read these in order! You're number 2 

      I probably should have murdered Jeremy Summers on general
      principles, considering how he was monkeying around with my life. 
      But I didn't. 

      I'm a realist. I'll give you an example. Years ago, when the IRS
      came after me and my barter service, I agreed to star in J. Walker's
      X-rated movies.  I made a lot of money, stayed out of jail, and
      financed my mail-order operation.  Simple.

      Business was great, until Jeremy got it in his head that he was
      going to reveal my unsavory past to the world.  That would have been
      very bad for business. I went to the theater to shut Jeremy up, but
      not with a gun.

      I just wanted to talk to him -- and without the pressure of knowing
      my company's future hung in the balance.  So I canceled my stock
      offering, at least for the time being.  Like I said, I'm a realist. 

      If I was going to kill him to protect the stock offering, why would
      I cancel the stock offering?

      I left the theater by way of the stage after Jeremy and I had our
      little chat, and took a cab up to my New York apartment.  I stayed
      up pretty late, making out checks for various social engineering
      programs sponsored by my favorite political party, Republican.
