      How To Be A Good Suspect

      If you've never been suspected of murder before, you might
      appreciate some of these tips:

      Don't give away too much information about yourself. Make people
      work to get at your secrets.

      Take notes. Pay attention. Listen for clues.

      Don't let people off the hook too easily. Be persistent. Remember: a
      murder has been committed and you need to get to the bottom of it.

      Stay in character. If you don't know the answer to someone's
      questions, bluff. Say something your character might say, but don't
      lie just to confuse people.

      Be evasive, put some spin on the truth, but try to stay within the
      bounds of "reality."

      If you like, carefully detach the chart on the last page of this
      clue booklet, and use it to keep track of everyone's movements.

      Above all, relax and have fun. You're only facing possible life in
      prison without parole.






































      * ROUND 1 : Watson

      Reveal this information only if it's unavoidable:

      1 )  You told Buffy you were going to New York on a business trip. 
      In a sense you were: you arrived at the Theatre Royale just after
      about 7:30, intent on getting finished with Summers. 

      You must reveal this information during this round:

      1 )  At approximately 7:40, you were in the Theater Royale lobby,
      and you saw a person you now recognize as Lisa Simpson, hurriedly
      leaving the theater.  You took special notice because this person
      was giggling, and seemed to have a large, leafy twig sticking out of
      one coat pocket.  Lisa left the theater, and got into a big blue
      limo, which immediately sped off.

      2 )  As the curtain rose for the first act, you spotted Summers'
      girlfriend Scully in the audience, seated just a few rows down from
      you. 

      3 )  Your wife has been depressed a lot lately, and -- how can you
      say this tactfully? -- you're concerned for her mental well-being. 
      Make the other guests aware of this, so they'll go easy on her.  
      (Don't reveal this, but the last thing you want her to do is crack
      up and make a fool of you, or worse.) 








































      * ROUND 2 : Watson

      Reveal this information only if it's unavoidable:

      1 )  When the curtain dropped on the first act (8:30) you noticed a
      door to right of the stage.  You left your seat and went over to it.

       It was unlocked, so you walked through it, and found yourself
      backstage.  Another doorway at the rear of the stage led to a spiral
      staircase.  You descended the staircase, and stepped through a
      connecting doorway into a long, deserted corridor.  There was an
      unused dressing room here, and further on, a half-open door with the
      words "Jeremy Summers" stenciled on it.  You heard the sounds of an
      argument here, and tiptoed closer to hear what was being said. 

      You must reveal this information during this round:

      1 )  You recently saw that old movie on tv, "Deliverance," where
      these vicious hillbillies attacked a group of campers, and the
      campers killed the hillbillies.  Jeremy had a bit part in it, his
      first film role.  You wonder if anyone else has seen it. SpongeBob
      maybe?  Be persistent. 

      2 )  You saw an article about Lisa Simpson in Real Estate Forum. 
      Nobody knows where the money's coming from, but it seems this smart
      entrepreneur has been buying up property all over the country for
      years, and has now settled in New York City.








































      * ROUND 3 : Watson

      You must reveal this information during this round:

      1 )  You saw that article about Scully in "Playbill" too.  It was a
      memoir written by one of Scully's Stanford University girlfriends. 
      She included a snapshot of Scully with her boyfriend, a big blonde
      guy.  The two of them were wearing backpacks and he had a shiny
      wooden walking stick.

      Reveal this information only if it's unavoidable:

      1 )   Alone now in the corridor, you waited, not sure of the best
      way to proceed.  A moment passed, and Summers came out of his
      dressing room.  You followed him up to the stage, demanding to know
      what he wanted from you.  He told you: fifty percent of the profits
      from the "Mask" films. 

















































      * ROUND 4 : Watson

      Reveal this information only if it's unavoidable:

      1 )  On the stage, just before the curtain went up on Act II, you
      pleaded with Summers, begging him not to tell Buffy about your
      secret identity.  "Then you'll do as I say," he replied.  "And
      remember, I want small bills, cash in a bag.  Now get off this
      stage..."  You went out through the doorway and back to your seat. 
      Throughout the second act, you seethed.  It galled you to let
      Summers get away with blackmail, and you thought hard about
      silencing him forever. 

      2 )  At nine o'clock, you saw Buffy leave her seat.  You followed
      her out to the lobby, and watched as she went downstairs to the
      lounge. You paced back and forth for twenty minutes, and finally
      made up your mind.  Then suddenly, you realized you weren't alone:
      two big, ugly thugs blocked your path -- a couple of goons working
      for the "investors" you'd bilked years ago.  They'd worked over one
      of your film freak buddies and he fingered you.  The goons told you
      they'd wait outside for fifteen minutes, that their boss was out
      there and he wanted to "talk."  Then they left.

      You must reveal this information during this round:

      1 )  At nine o'clock, you saw Buffy leave her seat.  You followed
      her out to the lobby, and watched as she went downstairs to the
      lounge. 

      2 )  You were in the men's room just before the curtain went up on
      the third and final act.  An usher was pleading with some lunatic in
      one of the stalls -- whoever it was wouldn't come out.  He was
      wearing a tight, unlaced pair of brown wingtips, and (judging by his
      bare legs), nothing else.

      Thanks for your time! Carefully detach this sheet from your clue
      booklet and present it to your host. Then, on to the thrilling
      conclusion...

























      Read these in order! You're number 3 

      By now you've probably figured out that I was once "J. Walker," the
      avant garde filmmaker who made a fortune directing X-rated films. 
      Edith was my star.

      I didn't kill Jeremy Summers.  That's not my style.  When I get into
      trouble I run.  That's what I did years ago when the gangsters who
      financed my movies decided they wanted their money back.  I couldn't
      part with all that cash, so I fled with the negatives, and had my
      faced changed by a wino plastic surgeon outside Reno.

      Later, I remembered Edith talked about this ditzy girl she once
      knew, Buffy.  She sounded great, so I tracked her down and married
      her.  It's worked out well.  Buffy has always been too nuts to
      realize that her husband secretly runs an X-rated film business.

      Everything was fine until Summers called me.  He wanted to blackmail
      me, to pay off someone who was blackmailing him, I think.  He
      threatened to expose me to Buffy, and that could have gotten me
      killed, so I went to the theater to meet with him.  Summers was
      arrogant and greedy, and I thought seriously about doing him in. 

      But all of a sudden, it didn't matter anymore.  The gangsters I've
      been hiding from all these years tracked me down.  A couple of
      muscleheads grabbed me in the theater lobby.  After the show, I met
      with their boss, and he's given me sixty days to pay off.  I'm
      financially ruined, but at least I'm alive.  And for once, I can
      stop running.
